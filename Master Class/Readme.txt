QuadSpinner
Master Class: Los Angeles
Limited Edition DVD
--------------------------

The Master Class presentation is divided into several segments across 5 sessions. For easy reference you can find each individual session in the MASTER CLASS folder. To play the entire presentation, run PlayAll.m3u.

Scenes, renders, animations, and slides can be found in their individual folders.

Please note you will need Vue 9.5 or higher to run the scenes properly. Vue 9 may be able to run most scenes that do not rely on 9.5 specific features.

The Limited Edition HyperTerrains and Render Profiles are provided in version-agnostic format.

If your favorite video player does not play the MP4 or F4V files the Master Class presentation is provided in, you may want to download the free VLC PLAYER from http://www.videolan.org or install from the SOFTWARE folder.

All content provided on this disc is strictly for educational purposes only. You may not use the contents of the disc except for the Limited Edition HyperTerrains and Render Profiles in personal or commercial projects. Please read the EULA.txt file for complete details.
