# Development Versions
A special folder called "Development Versions" contains many materials from Dax Pandhi's private library that have been used in many different things, from Battlestar Galactica&reg; to God of War&reg;. Many of these are "half cooked" materials that are easily modified for various situations. Some of them are not "ready to use" and may require a bit of work, but you can learn many different techniques used in professional productions.

# Unlocked Versions
Most materials, functions graphs, and metanodes will be unlocked, or have an unlocked copy, so you can dig into it and find out how we created our bestselling materials.
