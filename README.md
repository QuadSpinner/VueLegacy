As a "thank you" to all the thousands of users who supported QuadSpinner in its infancy, we have open sourced our material, MetaNode, and function library under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](license) license. You can use it for commercial use, modify and distribute the files as long as you link back to or attribute this repository.

# Software Requirement and Version Compatibility
Requires E-on Software's VUE. Most of the files were created with Vue 9.5, 10, and 11, so most recent versions will be able to open them.

# Development Versions
A special folder called "Development Versions" contains many materials from Dax Pandhi's private library that have been used in many different things, from Battlestar Galactica&reg; to God of War&reg;. Many of these are "half cooked" materials that are easily modified for various situations. Some of them are not "ready to use" and may require a bit of work, but you can learn many different techniques used in professional productions.

# Unlocked Versions
Most materials, functions graphs, and metanodes will be unlocked, or have an unlocked copy, so you can dig into it and find out how we created our bestselling materials.

# Need help?
You can open an [issue](https://github.com/QuadSpinner/VueLegacy/issues). Please note, this is not a commercial product so we cannot always provide help quickly. There are wonderful Vue communities (such as on Facebook) out there who will be able to help you if you have urgent needs!
